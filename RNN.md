Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Being human, when we watch a movie, we donâ€™t think from scratch every time while understanding any event. We rely on the recent experiences happening in the movie and learn from them. But, a conventional neural network is unable to learn from the previous events because the information does not pass from one step to the next. On contrary, RNN learns information from immediate previous step.
For example, there is a scene in a movie where a person is in a basketball court. We will improvise the basketball activities in the future frames: an image of someone running and jumping probably be labeled as playing basketball, and an image of someone sitting and watching is probably a spectator watching the game.
